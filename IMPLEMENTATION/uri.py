##### Problem

#URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a compact string used to identify or name
# resources on the Internet. Some examples of URI are below:

# http://icpc.baylor.edu.cn/
# mailto:foo@bar.org
# ftp://127.0.0.1/pub/linux
# readme.txt
#
# When transmitting *URI*s through the Internet, we escape
# some special characters in *URI*s with percent-encoding.
# Percent-encoding encodes an ASCII character into a percent
# sign ("%") followed by a two-digit Hexadecimal
# representation of the ASCII number. The other characters are
# not touched in the encoding process. The following table
# shows the special characters and their corresponding
# encodings:

# Special Character   Encoded String
# " "                 %20
# "!"                 %21
# "$"                 %24
# "%"                 %25
# "("                 %28
# ")"                 %29
# "*"                 %2a

# Note that the quotes are for clarity only.

# Write a program which reverses this process.


##### Input
#The first line of the input file will contain the number of test cases C
# (1≤C≤100). The following C lines will each contain a test case — which is the
# percent-encoded URI. Their length will be at most 80.

##### Output
# Print one line for each test cases — the decoded original URI.

n = int(input())
specialHash = {"%20":" ", "%21":"!", "%24":"$", "%25":"%", "%28":"(", "%29":")",
               "%2a":"*"}


for i in range(n):
    inputStr = input()
    outputStr = ""

    j = 0
    while (j < len(inputStr)):
        if inputStr[j:j+3] in specialHash:
            outputStr += specialHash[inputStr[j:j+3]]
            j = j + 3
        else:
            outputStr += inputStr[j]
            j = j + 1

    print (outputStr)
