##### Problem

# The two island nations Lilliput and Blefuscu are severe rivals. They dislike
# each other a lot, and the most important reason was that they break open boiled
# eggs in different ways.

# People from Lilliput are called little-endians, since they open eggs at the
# small end. People from Blefuscu are called big-endians, since they open eggs at
# the big end.

# This argument was not only about their breakfasts but about their computers,
# too. Lilliput and Blefuscu's computers differed in the way they store integers;
# they stored the bytes in different orders. Computers from
# Lilliput(*little-endians*) ordered it from the LSB(least significant byte) to
# the MSB(most significant byte), and computers from Blefuscu was exactly the
# opposite.
# For example, a 32-bit unsigned integer 305,419,896 (0x12345678) would be saved
# in two different ways:

# 00010010 00110100 01010110 01111000 (in an Blefuscu computer)
# 01111000 01010110 00110100 00010010 (in an Lilliput computer)

# Therefore, if there was any need to exchange information between
# Blefuscu and Lilliput computers, some kind of conversion process was
# inevitable. Since nobody liked converting the data by himself before
# sending, recipients always had to do the conversion process.

# Given some 32-bit unsigned integers retrieved in a wrong endian,
# write a program to do a conversion to find the correct value.

##### Input
# The first line of the input file will contain the number of test cases, C (1 ≤
# C ≤ 10, 000). Each test case contains a single 32-bit unsigned integer, which
# is the data without endian conversion.

##### Output
# For each test case, print out the converted number.

cases = int(input())
numbers = []
for case in range(cases):
    numbers.append(int(input()))

for number in numbers:
    hex = '{:x}'.format(number).zfill(8)
    hexList = []
    hexList.append(hex[6:])
    hexList.append(hex[4:6])
    hexList.append(hex[2:4])
    hexList.append(hex[0:2])

    ansString = ''.join(hexList)
    print(int(ansString, 16))
